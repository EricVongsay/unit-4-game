# unit-4-game
The objective of the game is to match your score to the random number that is generated for you.

Each crystal will have a random value assigned to it.

If your score goes over the target score, you lose.

If you correctly match your score to the target number, you win!


Working on this game, I was able to strengthen my skill with building nested arrays and generating random numbers. 

Using jQuery, I am able to learn the preset methods and learn the syntax such as manipulating the HTML file from the JavaScript file.
